6. Choose the correct statement about structures in C program:
a. Structure elements can be initialized at the time of declaration.
b. Structure members cannot be initialized at the time of declaration
c. Only integer members of structure can be initialized at the time of declaration
d. None of the above


Ans-opt b




7. What is the size of a C structure? How the size of a C structure is calculated?

Ans-Size of a C-structure depends upon the data member present in it. If it is a int data type then the size is 4bytes and for the pointer variable again 4bytes.
So for the structure-




      struct StructureName{
                  int data;
                  struct StructureName *next;
      }



The size is calculated as 4bytes + 4bytes.
